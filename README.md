Motivation
I have chosen this project because I am currently working on the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OES) survey for the state of Tennessee’s Labor and Workforce Department. I am working on collecting the data and compiling the data for submission to the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We do some analysis with the data we collect, but that is not our primary focus—the analysis is left more to the BLS. I think it will be interesting to see the analyses I can make with the dataset as someone who is well-acquainted with the data in a different capacity, and I am excited to have the opportunity to create visualizations with data very similar to the data I am working on at my job every day. In addition, as a person currently seeking employment, I am interested in learning more about industry and wage trends. While I may not be able to find information as specific as, say, how much a data analyst makes in Nashville, Tennessee, at specific employers, I do still think the information will be valuable. Even just knowing industry wages across the country can be helpful in determining a fair wage as someone seeking employment. Finally, I have a background in clinical psychology. Psychology will always have my heart, so to speak, and I naturally find myself wondering why things relating to people are the way they are. I added data regarding demographics for job applicants as a way to satiate my desire to constantly be learning about people.
Technologies
My capstone project has relied on three primary technologies: Python (version 3.8.5 within a Jupyter Notebook), Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Power BI. I did most of the data cleaning in Excel, while the actual analyses were done primarily through Python. Further analyses as well as dashboarding was done with Power BI. My final presentation was made with Google Slides, visualizations created in Python and Power BI were exported to the Google Slides presentation. Additionally, the website slidesgo.com was used for the Google Slides layout used in my presentation.
